<h3> African Rehab website :https://ar-center.netlify.app/ </h3>

<p> Due to the recent happenings. The Covid19 pandemic and all people have been laid off at work and this has played a negative role in the mental health of individuals and some people in this population has resulted in  drug use which has led many to  addiction.
Gender based violence has also become more pronounced in our societies and had has led to toxic mental spaces.
So 22 young African ladies came together and formed a coalition called Rehab Africa that believes so much in healing and everyone deserves wholeness. We are passionate about a healthy Africa and a healthy Africa is you and I.
Our mission is to build a safe, secure and healthy Africa one person at a time and our vision is to provide a structure with our website Rehab Africa for healing and wholesomeness during and after the program </p>

<br>

<p> We are "Rehab Africa", a company with the functionalities of therapy, creativity and community.
 Our mental health determines how  wholely we live our lives.
For instance; Did you know thatÂ within three years of release, 67.8 percent of ex-offenders are rearrested, and within five years, 76.6 percent are rearrested and a large percentage includes people with mental health disorder, this is where our platform comes in.

This platform is geared towards building a strong support system for people with "stress-related" issues while affording them the opportunity to get certified.
It involves a community of people who have walked this path before..what better way to create wholesome bonds.

A community whose mental health is prioritised will abound in peace and great positive  growth. </p>
